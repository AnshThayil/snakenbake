# Snake-N-Bake

This is my entry into [Battlesnake 2019](https://play.battlesnake.io/).
The goal of the competetion is to build a Snake Bot and compete with other developers.

This is forked from the [Python Starter Snake](https://github.com/battlesnakeio/starter-snake-python) provided by Battlesnake.

This snake made it through Round 1 of Battlesnake 2019.

A better version of the Snake Bot is under development under the ABetterSnake branch.
